##Palindromes on Palindromes

Just a few functions for checking, constructing, validating palindromes.

I've noticed this is a really popular type of question to ask in interviews so I decided to try and do all the different variations that I've seen this asked.

You can even try it out for yourself if you've got a word you want to check. [Palindrome Checker](http://maxehnert.github.io/palindromes-on-palindromes/)

You can find more of this type of stuff I've done here: [https://github.com/maxehnert/Algorithm-Problems](https://github.com/maxehnert/Algorithm-Problems) and here:  [https://github.com/maxehnert/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/blob/master/Answers/code.md](https://github.com/maxehnert/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/blob/master/Answers/code.md)
